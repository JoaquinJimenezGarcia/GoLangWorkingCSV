# Mergin CSV files

## Introduction
This Go program has been coded for an interview technical test for WP-Engine

#### Why GoLang
I have been working in GoLang only for two months since now but I find it a very
efficient and versatile language. It allows me to write good code in a short
period of time. Also, this is a language that is not very used commonly so it allows 
me to show I can offer new and different things to my next new company.

#### What it does
This program takes to arguments: an **input** file and an **output** file.
It will iterates throw the input file's records and making a request to its url
to have extra data and create a new file (the output file given as parameter) with
the current data and the new data.

## How to run it
**First of all you need to have Go installed.**

1. Compile the program using the CLI:
`go build wpe_merge.go`

2. Run the program:
`./wpe_merge <inputFileName> <outputFileName>`
